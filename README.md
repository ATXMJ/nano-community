# Nano.Community

**Vision & Purpose**

Nano.Community aims to be a portal to Nano's growing community by maintaining docs, guides, and conventions to improve community communication & onboarding.

**Primary Goals**

- Help new members discover and understand existing ideas, discussions in an easily consumable manner
- Help existing members point new members to old ideas, discussions, conclusions, etc
- Help new member onboarding, especially for code contributions from developers

**Secondary Goals**

- Serve as a chronicle of events, discussions, comments, ideas, etc. Documenting Nano culture & history
- Keep the community at large informed â€” serve as a centralized place to easily and quickly track an open and distributed project
- Measure community support for or against ideas by nano account based voting

## Design

At its core, this project will serve as both a knowledge hub and an overlay / gateway to the greater Nano community & ecosystem.

**Components**

- [Markdown documents (knowledge hub, wiki, etc)](#markdown-documents)
- [Community content aggregation & categorization](#content-aggregation--categorization)
- [Nano-based accounts & voting](#nano-based-accounts--voting)
- [Onboarding / contribution guides](#onboarding--contribution-guides)
- [Community conventions](#community-conventions)
- [Nano improvement proposals (i.e. RFC)](#nano-improvement-proposals-ie-rfc)

JavaScript & markdown are used to make the project as accessible as possible. Overtime, all elements of the project will be hosted and structured on IPFS to achieve immutability and permanence. The project aims to be open and distributed, allowing for it to operate indefinetly without reliance on centralized elements (servers, people, etc).

### Content Aggregation & Categorization

Automatic content aggregation, indexing, categorization and chronicling.

- Reddit Subreddit
- Reddit User
- Forum
- Discord
- Github

**Topics**

Content can be tagged to a topic to allow for members to easily explore past discussions around a certain topic. Each topic will have a neutral, concise, and high-level summary along with supporting & opposing arguments, and links to all past comments. Topics exist to easily point new members to past conversations as new members will naturally think of things already discussed by past members.

### Nano Based Accounts & Voting

Nano.Community accounts are a generated key-pair where the public key is signed by the private key pertaining to a nano account. This will allow associating a user's activity to an account on the nano network. The signing process will take place within a wallet (or on the commandline) and will not increase the risk/attack surface for a nano private key. This feature can be used to automate moderation of contributions as well as measuring support for or against certain proposals.

### Onboarding / Contribution Guides

- Nano Documentation
- Nano Reference Implementation
- Nano.Community

### Community Conventions

Community conventions will set forth best practices on how to format/structure posts across various platforms in the nano community.

- Reddit
- Forum
- Discord
- Github

### Nano Improvement Proposals (i.e. RFC)
