### Nano Based Accounts & Voting

Accounts are a generated key-pair where the public key is signed by the private key pertaining to a nano account. This will allow associating a user's actions and content to an account (representative) on the nano network. The signing process will take place within a wallet (or on the commandline) and will not increase the risk/attack surface for a nano private key. This feature can be used to automate moderation of contributions as well as measuring support for or against certain content (proposals, ideas, comments, etc).

### Content Aggregation

Automatic content aggregation and indexing

- Reddit Subreddit
- Reddit User
- Forum
- Discord
- Github

### Content Categorization

Content can be tagged to a topic to allow for members to easily explore past discussions around a certain topic. Each topic will have a neutral, concise, and high-level summary with links to notable comments. Topics exist to easily point new members to past conversations as new members will naturally think of things already discussed by past members.
