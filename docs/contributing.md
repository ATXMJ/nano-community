# Contributing

Nano has a relatively small community of developers and only a handful of developers employed at the <a href="https://nano.org/en/foundation" target="_blank">Nano Foundation</a>. Therefore, contributions from the community can make a big difference. Start by reviewing the following contributions guides:

- Support the <a href="https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-docs/" target="_blank">official Nano documentation</a>
- Contribute code to the <a href="https://docs.nano.org/node-implementation/contributing/" target="_blank">reference nano node implementation</a>
- Help with <a href="https://docs.nano.org/running-a-node/beta-network/" target="_blank">beta testing</a>

Next, participate in community [discussions](/community), by reading and replying to GitHub issues, forum posts and discord messages. This gives you a great insight into the pain points that currently exist with the software.

### Contribute to the ecosystem

- <a href="https://github.com/mistakia/nano-community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">Nano.Community</a>: community gateway and knowledge hub
- <a href="https://github.com/Nault/Nault/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">Nault</a>: one of the most popular community maintained wallets
