# Contributing

## Development

Nano has a relatively small community of developers and only a handful of developers employed at the <a href="https://nano.org/en/foundation" target="_blank">Nano Foundation</a>. Therefore, contributions from the community can make a big difference. Start by reviewing the following contributions guides:

- Support the <a href="https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-docs/" target="_blank">official Nano documentation</a>
- Contribute code to the <a href="https://docs.nano.org/node-implementation/contributing/" target="_blank">reference nano node implementation</a>
- Help with <a href="https://docs.nano.org/running-a-node/beta-network/" target="_blank">beta testing</a>

Next, participate in community [discussions](/community), by reading and replying to <a href="https://forum.nano.org/" target="_blank">forum posts</a> and <a href="https://chat.nano.org/" target="_blank">discord messages</a>. This gives you a great insight into the pain points that currently exist with the software.

#### Contribute to the ecosystem

- <a href="https://github.com/mistakia/nano-community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">Nano.Community</a>: community gateway and knowledge hub
- <a href="https://github.com/Nault/Nault/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">Nault</a>: a popular community maintained wallet

## Marketing

Before you can effectively contribute to Nano adoption and marketing it is a good idea to have a working understanding of the following:

- [Why it matters](/introduction/why-it-matters)
- [Advantages](/introduction/advantages)
- [Investment Thesis](/introduction/investment-thesis)
- [How it works](/introduction/how-it-works)
- [Misconceptions](/introduction/misconceptions)

Next, you'll want to understand the vision and roadmap so that we all pull in the same direction.

#### Vision, Roadmap & Goals

Nano aims to be a form of money both replacing existing use cases (payments, remittances, donations, etc) and inventing new previously impossible use cases (micropayments, "streaming" value, etc). Thus, use as a system to transfer value is the focus.

Being that Nano is a protocol, to help increase use of the network, it is important to attract entrepeneurs, developers and enthusiasts to help build and improve it. Nano, much like the internet at first, is still hard to use for the vast majority of consumers and businesses. Thus we need builders to make it more accessible so that everyone can use it.

#### Target Audience

##### Speculators / Holders

Before Nano could sustain much real world payment volume it needs to be worth something and have enough liquidity. Thus before there is utility, we need speculators and holders. Due to the positive feedback loop of its network effects, the more who are invested, the more attention the project gets, the more resources that are available, which then attracts even more investors, companies, developers and exchanges continuing the feeddback loop.

##### Open source developers
