### How can Nano be useful as a currency if the price is volatile?

All currencies have exchange rate volatility. When Nano is widely adopted and denominated, it's volatiltiy will not be noticeable. Its price will be more stable as it will be driven by usage as oppose to entirely driven by speculation.

### How can Nano be useful as a currency if the price is always appreciating?

Nano's value is driven by two things: use of the payment system today and speculation on future use.

At this moment, its value, measured in market cap, is relatively low and almost entirely driven by speculation. If adopted and used as money, the value will inevitably be much higher and driven by utility as opposed to pure speculation, similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market" target="_blank">currency markets today</a>.

As it approaches wide adoption, the market cap growth will level off and it will behave more as a store of value than an investment. In other words, it will preserve purchasing power, not necessarily increase it. Over time, as adoption increases it will transition from an investment that can be spent to just digital money.
