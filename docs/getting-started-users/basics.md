## Nano is experimental & under development

Nano is an experimental new currency that is in active development. Each improvement makes Nano more appealing but can also reveal new challenges as it operates in uncharted waters. You might encounter slow or stalled confirmations, downtime, or even more severe issues.

Be prepared for problems.

At some point Nano's protocol will mature, but it is never done. Currently, there exists a large gap between Nano conceptually and Nano operationally. Over time this gap will close.

## Securing your account

As it is with physical money, digital money needs to be secured. If left unprotected or handled carelessly, it can be lost, stolen, or destroyed.

Nano can provide very high levels of security if used correctly. Learn how you can [secure your account](/getting-started-users/storing/basics).

## Securing the network

Nano's network is secured by its holders through nodes that cast votes on behalf of them. Therefore, anyone in possession of Nano is responsible for safeguarding their voting weight and maintaining the networks security.

Nano holders can run their own nodes to cast votes or they can delegate their voting weight to someone else who is running a node. They have the ability to re-delegate their voting weight at any time. Delegating your voting weight has no impact on your funds, as you remain in full control of them and can use them as you normally would.

Delegating voting weight should not be done lightly as it is the main thing securing and controlling the network.

#### How do I change my Nano representative?

You broadcast a change rep operation to the network for a given Nano account. This can be done via most wallet applications.

<small>_Note: If you are not self-custodying Nano, then that Nano and its voting weight is not in an account you control. It is not advised to use exchanges for long-term storage nor is it good for network security to allow exchanges to accumulate a large portion of the voting weight._</small>

#### Where can I find a good representative?

Do not randomly select a representative, you should know the maintainer and why they are running a node/representative. Additionally, a good choice should have:

- A high uptime
- Below 1 % of total voting weight
- Not newly created, the older the better
- Active & known community member

If you donâ€™t know any node maintainers, <a href="https://mynano.ninja/" target="_blank">My Nano Ninja</a> or <a href="https://nanocharts.info/need-a-representative" target="_blank">nanocharts.info</a> are good starting points. Try to select a node operator whose known and has a good reputation on the various online [communities](/community).

## Privacy

Nano puts you in control of your privacy. It then becomes your responsibility and choice when you reveal it. All transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network, which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any account. However, the identity of the user behind an account remains unknown until information is revealed during a purchase or in other circumstances. This is one reason why an account should only be used once. It is your responsibility to adopt good practices and use services that protect your privacy.

## Nano payments are irreversible

Nano transactions work just like physical cash, it cannot be reversed, it can only be refunded by the person receiving the funds. This means you should be mindful of who you transact with.

## Unconfirmed transactions

Most of the time, you may not notice unconfirmed transactions as they will settle before you can blink. At times, due to network congestion or poorly integrated services, you may have to wait for a transaction to become confirmed.

## Price volatility

The price of a Nano can unpredictably increase or decrease over a short period of time due to its young economy, novel nature, and sometimes illiquid markets. Consequently, keeping your savings with Nano is not recommended at this point. Nano should be seen like a high risk, asymmetric investment, and you should never store money that you cannot afford to lose with Nano.

Lean more about how it is [an asymmetric investment now](/introduction/investment-thesis) before it stabilizes as a store of value used as digital money.

## Taxes and regulation

Even though Nano is not officially recognized and regulated, most jurisdictions still require you to pay taxes on it. It is your responsibility to ensure that you adhere to tax and other legal or regulatory mandates issued by your government and/or local municipalities.
