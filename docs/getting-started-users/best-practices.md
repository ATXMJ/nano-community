# Best Practices

#### General

- Do not use wallets that don't provide you the generated secret key or seed. If you do not have the secret key for a given nano account, you do not control that account. It is that simple.
- Avoid closed source wallets
- Never enter your secret key into a website
- Never message or email your secret key or seed
- Avoid re-using addresses

#### Suggestions

- Desktop wallets that are open source can be safer than mobile wallets because you can validate the checksum
- Generate a secret key or seed on a computer that is not connected to the internet, or ideally has never connected to the internet
