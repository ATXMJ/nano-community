# Privacy

Nano puts you in control of your privacy. You can protect it and decide when to reveal it.

To protect your privacy, you should use a new Nano address each time you receive a new payment. It is good practice to use multiple accounts for different purposes. Doing so allows you to isolate each of your transactions in such a way that it is not possible to associate them all together. This prevents people who send you money from seeing what other addresses you own, how much you have, and what you do with it.

Over time and with more development, there will be services and <a href="https://github.com/mistakia/nanowallet" target="_blank">prviacy focused wallets</a> that help make it effortless to manage and protect your privacy.

## Protecting your Privacy

### Sourcing your Nano

The majority of exchanges and services will require some level of "Know your customer" (KYC), as it is a regulation that any business with a banking relationship has to abide by. These rules are imposed worldwide and are geared towards ensuring that a business acting as a money exchange and/or transmitter has ‘suitable’ information on every customer they serve.

#### What information will I have to provide?

- Name
- Address
- Phone number
- Drivers license
- Government ID
- A selfie holding a piece of paper with the name of the exchange and the date

#### Why is providing this information a risk?

KYC information ties your personal identity to any nano you purchase. The exchange or service can know

- How much you bought
- When you bought it
- Your banking information
- Where you withdraw to

A centralized collection of sensitive and personal information creates an attraction and puts your privacy at risk of being leaked due to incompetent security practices.

#### How can I get some no-KYC Nano?

- Purchase from <a href="https://www.kucoin.com/" target="_blank">KuCoin.com</a> without KYC
- Earn it
- Sell unwanted goods for it
- Buy it from a friend or at a local meetup
- Provide value to others and have a donations page
