Nano (NANO), formerly RaiBlocks (XRB), is a peer-to-peer digital currency. It is a decentralized, open-source cryptocurrency that enables free, instant, and energy-efficient payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It operates without intermediaries, using a distributed ledger with a unique block-lattice data structure collectively managed by a peer-to-peer network.

Nano was launched in October 2015 by Colin LeMahieu to address the limitations in existing cryptocurrencies that prevented large scale adoption and would result in restrictive fees and increased transaction confirmation times during congestion. Nano's scalability is not limited by its protocol and aims to have feeless transactions that typically achieve full confirmation in under one second.

## History

Development began in 2014 by Colin LeMahieu, under its original name of RaiBlocks. On 31 January 2018, RaiBlocks rebranded to Nano. Nano was distributed for free through a Captcha-based faucet which started in 2015. The faucet was shut down in 2017 after 126,248,289 NANO were distributed. Along with a 7,000,000 NANO developer fund, this fixed the total supply to 133,248,297 NANO.
