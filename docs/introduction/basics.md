# Introduction

Nano (NANO), formerly RaiBlocks (XRB), is a peer-to-peer digital currency that enables free, instant, and sustainable value transfer to anyone, anywhere in the world. It operates without intermediaries, using a distributed ledger with a unique block-lattice data structure collectively managed by a peer-to-peer network.

Nano was launched in October 2015 by Colin LeMahieu to address the limitations in existing digital currencies that prevented large scale adoption and would result in restrictive fees and increased transaction confirmation times during congestion. Nano's scalability is not limited by its protocol and aims to have feeless transactions that typically achieve full confirmation in under one second.

### History

In 2008, an individual under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper outlining the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. A key innovation was the blockchain, a public, immutable and decentralized data-structure which is used as a ledger for the currency’s transactions. Unfortunately, as Bitcoin matured, it became clear that several issues with this key innovation made Bitcoin prohibitive for many applications. In 2014, Colin LeMahieu released a whitepaper outlining a novel block-lattice architecture where each account has its own blockchain, enabling near instant confirmation, feeless transactions, and scalability that is not limited by protocol-side variables like block sizes or block times. Nano addresses the limitations with Bitcoin's blockchain while improving upon Bitcoin's core properties, giving it an absolute advantage. Development began in 2014 and the network was launched in 2015, under its original name of RaiBlocks. On 31 January 2018, RaiBlocks rebranded to Nano. Nano was distributed for free through a Captcha-based faucet which started in 2015. The faucet was shut down in 2017 after 126,248,289 NANO were distributed. Along with a 7,000,000 NANO developer fund, this fixed the total supply to 133,248,297 NANO.
