Nano is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing#Peer-to-peer" target="_blank">decentralized protocol</a> run by node operators, services, and users. This protocol allows for a network of computers to collectively manage and maintain a distributed ledger without having to trust one another. A computer running the protocol that has a copy of the ledger is called a node. Nano has two main types of nodes: voting nodes and non-voting nodes.
