# Misconceptions

### There is no incentive to run a node

Those familiar with nakamoto consensus (i.e. Bitcoin) mistakenly believe that an incentive is a requirement for all distributed ledger designs. It is only a requirement for nakamoto consensus, which is based on a synchronous blockchain.

Nano does not use a synchronous blockchain and thus does not need to incentive the network to produce blocks and secure the network. Not having an incentive has major advantages, as it enables the following to coexist:

- feeless tx prioritization
- resist <a href="https://medium.com/@clemahieu/emergent-centralization-due-to-economies-of-scale-83cc85a7cbef" target="_blank">emergent centralization due to economies of scale</a>
- network and security controlled entirely by holders
- a fixed supply

Many people also conflate a "node" and a "miner". The former is not incentivized, it is only the later that is incentivized. The incentives and reasons to run a node in Bitcoin and Nano are the same. In both cases, the low cost of running a node allows people to run them to use the network without have to trust or rely on anybody else. The advantage in Nano's case is that it doesn't cost much more to run a node that also secures the network, whereas the cost to run miners to secure the bitcoin network is prohibitive and left to those who can profit from doing so.

### Nano is too volatile to be a store of value or currency

All currencies (i.e. fiat money) are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market" target="_blank">volatile</a>. It is not noticeable when it is widely adopted and denominated.

In other words, the day to day price of milk, denominated in USD, is stable even though USD as a currency has day to day exchange rate volatility.

Nano has very little usage and adoption as a form of money. It can not go from zero usage and denomination to widely adopted and denominated without drastic changes in price.

Currently, the price is entirely driven by speculation. In other words, Nano's value is not driven by its use but because people believe it will be used. As it grows to be widely adopted and denominated, the value will no longer be determined purely from speculation. Therefore, it will go through phases and some properties will change.

The currency has to be worth something before it could bear any amount of real-world payment volume. This is a classic “chicken and egg” problem with new technology: new technology is not worth much until it’s worth a lot.

Also, Nano can be used as a payment network by merchants without exposing them to the exchange volatility as they can trade in and out of it, as oppose to holding it.

### Nano is a bad currency because it's deflationary or lacks inflation

Nearly all modern money systems are based on fiat money, leading to a confusion and a lack of distinction between **fiat money** and **money**.

Nano is a bad form of **fiat money** but a superior form of **money**.

It's a bad form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money" target="_blank">fiat money</a> because it can not be used to respond to economic events, since governments can not control its supply. However, it's a better form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money" target="_blank">money</a> as it has superior properties of money, mainly its store of value properties because governments can not control its supply.

**properties of money**

- Fungibility: its individual units must be capable of mutual substitution
- Durability: able to withstand repeated use.
- Divisibility: divisible to small units.
- Portability: easily carried and transported.
- Cognizability: its value must be easily identified.
- Scarcity: its supply in circulation must be limited.
- Acceptability: widely accepted

### Nano is energy-efficient because nobody uses the network

The energy cost of producing and processing a transaction is constant. In fact, the network is most efficient at capacity (energy usage per tx).

### Nano is doomed because the developer fund is low

Nano is an open source project, a peer-to-peer network, and a set of ideas that does not rely on any one person, developer or operator to exist. Some play much larger roles than others but its existence doesn't depend on them, it depends on anyone who recognizes its usefulness.

It will not become any less useful if the developer fund runs out, those who recognize that will be more quick to support the project than abandon it. Bitcoin never had a developer fund and it's been just fine.

### Nano will be replaced by a competitor

Since its release, Bitcoin has been forked and cloned countless times. None of these clones have been able to gain much traction because they lack <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html" target="_blank">legitmacy</a>, a quality that can not be forged in decentralized networks.

For a competitor to replace Nano, it will likely need to materially improve upon Nano's fundamental properties. There is not much room for improvement, given Nano is instant, feeless, energy-efficient, scalable, and irreversible. Based on those qualities and how <a href="/history/overview">few advances there have been over the last 30 years</a>, it may be more likely that Nano is not viable then there being an improvement discovered that is incompatible.
