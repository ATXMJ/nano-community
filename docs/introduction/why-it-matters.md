The core function of money is being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_of_exchange" target="_blank">medium of exchange</a> that enables society to collaborate, cooperate, organize, specialize, and much more. Thus money, like communication, is foundational to society as it is a prerequisite for all complex cooperation. The concept of money was one of the first, and among the most important, collaborative innovations.

The concept of money is believed to have originated in the form of "promises" (i.e. debt), sometimes kept on a publicly accesible ledger (sound familiar?).
