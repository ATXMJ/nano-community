# Privacy

Privacy is an important and necessary property of digital money.

Because Nano uses a public pseudonymous ledger, further development is needed to lessen the burden on end users as humans are error prone and generally don't care about privacy until they do. Pseudonymous ledgers like Nano have all the ingredients to allow for shielding your transaction history and accounts: infinite and free pseudonymous accounts with free transactions. To get an idea of how anonymity sets can be created on a public pseudonymous ledger check out the <a href="https://medium.com/samourai-wallet/diving-head-first-into-whirlpool-anonymity-sets-4156a54b0bc7" target="_blank">Samurai wallet</a> for bitcoin.

The advantage of achieveing obfuscation/privacy with a pseudonymous ledger is a lighter, faster, and more scalable base protocol as layer one privacy proofs are bulky and require greater computation. In the meantime, it is important you follow [best practices](/getting-started-users/privacy) to manage and protect your privacy.
